# Summary

* During these labs you experienced some of the features and capabilities of Oracle Analytics:
    * Ingested and enhanced an excel file
    * Used search bar and embedded ML to analyze
    * Created maps and visuals easily
    * Mashed-up another dataset and joined within your project
* And this was just a small part of all the capabilities available in Oracle Analytics, we did not have the time to explore others like: Create Machine Learning models, use Dataflows to move and manage data, connect to 3rd party services, Pixel-Perfect reports, bursting, Enterprise Dashboardingâ€¦
* But more important than all that is that you experienced how Oracle Analytics can help you solve problems.
* We hope that you enjoyed doing the labs.
* Thank you for your time.
